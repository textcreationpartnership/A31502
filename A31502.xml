            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir WILL. KILLIGREVVS Anſwer in the behalfe of himſelfe, and the reſt of the Drayners, to the Paper hee received from Mr. HOVVET.</head>
            <p>THat the Owners and Commoners Petition above mentioned, (which they fay was fully proved at a Committee) wee ſay was untrue and ſcandalous, and in no point proved, as touching the Undertakers proceedings, which were by many Witneſſes at the ſame Committee proved to bee juſt, and legall; and thoſe proofes doe now remaine in Maſter <hi>Ellis</hi> his hands, with all the Decrees made in that buſineſſe: And we doe further ſay, that the Owners and Commoners did not then, nor can now prove any of their unjuſt Accuſations againſt the Drayners, nor was the cauſe ſo fully heard that Maſter <hi>Ellis</hi> can be capable to report
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108040:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 34 -->it who had not any Vote or Authority from that Committee to make a Report, the ſaid Committee being under Adjornment for ſome Moneths, during which Adjournment ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, with thoſe that now hold up this Conteſt againſt us, did reject the Juſtice of the ſaid Committee, and Parliament, by deſtroying the Undertakers Works, poſſeſſing themſelves of their Lands, and ſo became their owne Judges while the cauſe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: by which it appeares, that their proofes then were not ſuch as they now pretend, or durſt then truſt to: Nor was Maſter <hi>Ellis</hi> then fit for a Report of the cauſe as now they ſay he is; and that Committee being now nine yeares elapſed, He is leſſe fit to make 2 Report.</p>
            <p>To the next part of Maſter <hi>Howetts</hi> Paper wee anſwer, That by the Authority of a Grand Commiſſion of Sewers, wee are Undertakers indiſputably by the knowne Lawes of the Land; and that the Parliament hath admitted us Undertakers, in their Order to this Committee; and the Committee have recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Owners and Commoners, with their Counſell at the Barre, this Treaty with us the Undertakers, and Adventurers with the Earle of <hi>Lindſey:</hi> Which now it ſeemes thoſe Owners and Commoners will not allow of, unleſſe themſelves may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (after the worke finiſhed upon our particular charges) joynt undertakers with us; without which they will not treat of any Agreement; Wilfully miſtaking the intent of the Committee, which was, that we ſhould Treat of ſatisfaction to bee made by both Parties, for the Injuries complained of on both ſides. We expected to heare of ſome Demands to repaire the Loſſes and the great Dammage by us done to the poore Commoners, by our illegall proceedings (as they ſay) and they give us onely a Demand that ſome of thoſe who have againſt all Law and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſtroyed our Workes and Poſſeſſions ſhould now be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Drayners with us; as if that would cleanſe us from guilt, if we were guilty, and fully ſatisfie the injured Commoners, if they were injured. Tis indeed a very modeſt demand, that thoſe our Deſtroyers may now be Undertakers with us, to Drain what wee have already Drayned; They have torne our Coats from our backs, and would now have a large ſhare of our Coats to helpe us mend what they have torne; this were an excellent

            <p>Thirdly, to let the world ſee, that a few mens ingratitude, who appeare at the Committee againſt us, ſhall not have power to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our intentions to give all juſt ſatisfaction to the Countrey, who have beene generally miſled, and miſ-informed by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable guides, who hope to beare out their owne guilts by the poore Commoners innocency; We ſay, that if the poore Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners doe deſire our Friendſhip, wee will forget and forgive all our Loſſes, and Injuries by them done to us, as by men miſ-led; (and if the generallity of the Countrey doe deſire it,) wee will admit ſuch of the Lords and Owners as they ſhall nominate, and the Parliament allow of, to become Undertakers, and Adventurers with us in our ſecond Levell not yet finiſhed; or if they like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we will remit unto them the whole undertaking of that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell not yet finiſhed, ſo we may have a part proportionable to our Charge already expended to wards that Worke, for we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſatisfie the Countrey any way we can. But 'twere a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſpeake of admitting any of them Undertakers with us in our firſt Levell, long ſince Drained at our owne Charge, and all thoſe Lands of ours, long ſince diſpoſed of to ſuch men as have payed more for the Purchaſe, than any of the Lords or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will now repurchaſe them at.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſince they doe reject the Committees advice, to Treat of an Accommodation with us the Drainers, for wrongs alledged to bee done on both ſides, and doe not accept that gracious prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the Committee, to beſtow the Kings Lands on them; We ſhall be humble Sutors to the Committee, to become Sutors to the Parliament, that thoſe Lands may be allotted to repaire the Works for the good of the Common-wealth; and let our Lands be liable to make a juſt ſatisfaction for all the wrongs by us done to the Countrey: for our Adverſaries will finde that we doe not value thoſe Clamorous Scandalls they vent againſt us; And wee doe Declare, that 'tis no dread of any guilt, that moves us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Treaty with them, but a reall deſire to gaine the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes Love, that wee may live like Chriſtians together; which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108040:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->ſome men for their own guilts doe hinder, others for private ends, and their particular profit doe oppoſe. For when thoſe Papers, and thoſe Decrees in Maſter <hi>Ellis</hi> his hands ſhall bee delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Committee, our Adverſaries Ingratitude and Impudence will bluſh for calling us Projectors, and Oppreſſors of the Poore; By which Papers wee ſay it will appeare, that we are as innocent from the firſt guilt, as they alone guilty of the laſt: Who doe eate out the poore Commoners with their great Stocks; and doe now gather the poore mens money to maintaine their owne op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on them, to the diſcontent of the major part of the Commoners, who ſay they date not complaine for feare of more and more oppreſſion from their rich Neighbours, who doe make them pay equall charge for repairing and maintaining the Drains, though they have no benefit by the Commons, as will be ſhortly proved: And no doubt the poore Commoners will bee relieved, when their Cauſe is knowne in Parliament, and their Commons bee ſtinted for the future benefit of the poore, in caſe they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, leſt ſome of our Adverſaries doe not know, and others have forgotten upon what tearms wee became Undertakers, 'tis thought fit we put them in minde, that in Maſter <hi>Ellis</hi> his hands doth remaine the Countreyes firſt invitation to the Earle of <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyes</hi> undertaking this worke; which cleares the Earle from being a Projector as they alledge.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, It will alſo appeare by the Records of Sewers in Maſter <hi>Ellis</hi> his hands, that this Contract for the Drayning was above three yeares in agitation after the Tax of 13 s. 4 d. was laid on the Fennes, by 35 Commiſſioners, the prime Gentlemen of that Countrey; for 'twas three yeares after this taxing, that the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ine was compleated with the Earle by 32 Commiſſioners, and this done with the generall applauſe of a great aſſembly of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners then preſent, who wrought in the ſaid workes above two yeares, and were enriched by our moneyes; and in all this time, no word of any diſlike to the Earls undertaking; which ſhewes that the people were not diſpleaſed with the Draining, nor did then thinke it a Project.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, it will appeare by the writings with Maſter <hi>Ellis,</hi> that Sir <hi>John Brooke,</hi> ſince Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Hern,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108040:4"/>

Fennes, at forty ſhillings the acre, which was the price offered by the Earle to the whole Country, though Maſter <hi>William Langron,</hi> with them two before named, did onely value thoſe lands, in thoſe dayes ſo much worth, by reaſon of the charge, and hazzard in Draining; and by the Dates of their Bills of Adventure, it will appeare they became Adventurers five yeares after their firſt Tax, and above two years after the Contract was made with the Earle; ſo they could not be parties intereſſed, and Judges at making the Contract for the Drayning, as our Adveriaries doe maliciouſly averre againſt their owne Conſciences. Thus clearely we can confute all the roſt of their Clamours againſt us; and ſo doing we have no doubt but the Parliament having lately ſetled <hi>Bedford</hi> Levell by an Act, which is a worke yet to doe, they will alſo ſettle <hi>Landſey</hi> Levell, which is a worke done; and the beſt worke of that kinde that was ever yet done in this Land; all the Earles proceedings in the worke being after the Example of former Draining heretofore incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſetled by former Parliaments; and the ſame with the Earle of <hi>Bedfords,</hi> which is by all paſt Parliaments, and by this Parliament, allowed to bee greatly beneficiall to the Common-wealth: hoping alſo that the Parliament in their Wiſedomes will not permit our Adverſaries (by giving us the Title of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents) to eclipſe our good deſerving in the Undertaking, and accompliſhing ſo great and beneficiall a Worke for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as wee have done by this Drayning: and alſo will take into Conſideration, that the Profits of our Lands for theſe laſt nine yeares ought to have been ſequeſtred to the uſe of the State, and not imbeſeled to the particular Intereſts of a few rich men; and alſo will looke on us with equall favour; becauſe after our Compoſitions made, and upon our good behaviour ſince, all occaſion of that advantage to call us Delinquents, is clearely taken off. We doe therefore Declare to our Adverſaries, who reject a Treaty with us, that we do wholly rely on our juſt cauſe, and the Juſtice of the Parliament, to reſtore us, and repare us, that have done the Common-wealth ſo great a Service by this Dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Yet not withſtanding all the aſperity that has paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and ſome of the Owners and Commoners, wee are

               <!-- PDF PAGE 36 -->ſtill ſo well-affected to them, that if all the Lords, Owners, and Commoners ſhall thinke fit to meet us with the like Affection, and come to a friendly Agreement with us, before the next day of Hearing, wee will give them full ſatisfaction for any Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we have done them, and will forgive them all Injuries by them done to us: and will remit unto them all the Melioration we are to have out of their ſeveralls, which is like to bee a fifth part of our Contract, and our right, beyond Contradiction. And we thinke this a ſufficient expreſſion of our Affection to the Countrey, who know no guilt to make us dread their diſpleaſure and yet doe ſeek to purchaſe their loves at ſo deare a rate.</p>
